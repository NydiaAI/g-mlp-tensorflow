# gmlp-tensorflow
A gMLP (gated MLP) implementation in Tensorflow 1.x, as described in the paper  ["Pay Attention to MLPs" (2105.08050)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08050). 

This project is a port of [lucidrains/g-mlp-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/g-mlp-pytorch) to Tensorflow 1.x, for all of us losers that still have to use it.
